Tree algorithms in C

Some simple implementations of tree traversal algorithms.

The recursive pre-order, in-order and post-order ones are easy, but shown for reference.

Then I implement the iterative versions on top of a basic stack implementation.

Finally I show the breadth first search (BFS) tree traversal algorithm, and notice that it is basically identical to the pre-order iterative traversal.

I also added recursive code to do serialization and de-serialization of a tree to a string format. I had never thought of this before, but was asked to do it in a recent job interview.
